# React.js Single Page Application with Hono API, Auth0 AI, AI SDK, and Token Vault

This is a [React.js](https://react.dev) Single Page Application that implements [Auth0 AI](https://auth0.ai) along with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) to create a chat bot with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) as the LLM provider. The application demonstrates how to integrate the AI SDK with Auth0 AI to implement: Authentication & Authorization of apps & APIs with Auth0.

![Access Token Exchange Token Vault](public/access-token-exchange-token-vault.png)

Auth0's Token Vault enables an API to exchange a SPA's access token for a Third-Party API access token. One use case this may help in particular is the case the agent is a Single Page Application (or chatbot), and you would like the backend API to access a Third Party API (such as Google) on the user's behalf. This approach addresses a key security challenge for applications that cannot securely store refresh tokens, such as Single Page Applications. By supporting access tokens as subject tokens, these applications can delegate the token exchange to a trusted backend service that manages the credentials securely.

The flow works by having the client send its access token to a First Party API, which then performs the token exchange using its own client credentials (i.e. client_id and client_secret). This is particularly valuable for scenarios where applications need to access external APIs like Google Calendar or Salesforce without directly managing sensitive refresh tokens.

## Features

The following example app demonstrates using a SPA chatbot application, a backend API (and a linked Custom API Client), and Token Vault to access a Third Party API (Google Calendar API).

This template leverages a modern stack for building a React SPA application with a Hono API.

- **Full-Stack TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety between client and server
- **Shared Types**: Common type definitions shared between client and server
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as a workspaces-based monorepo with Turbo for build orchestration
- **Modern Stack**:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as the JavaScript runtime
  - [npm](https://npmjs.com) as the package manager with workspace support
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev) as the backend framework
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for frontend bundling
  - [React](https://react.dev) for the frontend UI
  - [Turbo](https://turbo.build) for monorepo build orchestration and caching

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

You will need the following prerequisites to run this app:
- Node.js 18 or later
- npm 7 or later (for workspace support)
- An [OpenAI key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries#create-and-export-an-api-key) for accessing OpenAI
- Setup and configure a Google Cloud Project for use with the Google Connection
   - Enable the [Google Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com).
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials with proper redirect URIs.

### 1. Auth0 Configuration

1. Create an Auth0 SPA Application:
   - Go to your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/)
   - Create a new **Single Page Application**
   - Configure the following settings:
     - **Allowed Callback URLs**: `http://localhost:5173`
     - **Allowed Logout URLs**: `http://localhost:5173`
     - **Allowed Web Origins**: `http://localhost:5173`
     - Enable "Allow Refresh Token Rotation"
     - Enable "Refresh Token" in Grant Types under Advanced Settings

2. Create an Auth0 API that represents your Hono API back-end:
   - In your Auth0 Dashboard, go to APIs
   - Create a new API with an identifier (audience)
   - Make sure to "Allow Offline Access" in Access Settings 
   - Note down the API identifier for your environment variables

3. Create a Custom API Client (for Token Vault Token Exchange):
   - This is a special application that allows your API to perform token exchanges
   - In your Auth0 Dashboard, on the configuration page of your API, click the "Add Application" button in the header and create the Custom API Client
   - Ensure that the `Token Vault` grant type is enabled under the Advanced Settings
   - Note down the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" of this newly created Custom API Client
   - Now your Custom API will be able to use Token Vault, to exchange an access token for an external API access token (e.g., Google Calendar API)

4. Grant access to My Account API from your application
   - When a call to Token Vault fails due to the user not having a connected account (or lacking some permissions), this demo triggers a Connect Account flow for this user. This flow leverages Auth0's [My Account API](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/my-account-api), and as such, your application will need to have access to it in order to enable this flow.
   - In order to grant access, use the [Application Access to APIs](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/application-access-to-apis-client-grants) feature, by creating a client grant for user flows.
   - In your Auth0 Dashboard, go to APIs, and open the Settings for "Auth0 My Account API".
   - On the Settings tab, make sure to enable the "Allow Skipping User Consent" toggle.
   - On the Applications tab, authorize your application, ensuring that the `create:me:connected_accounts` permission at least is selected.

5. Define a Multi-Resource Refresh Token policy for your SPA Application
   - After your SPA Application has been granted access to the My Account API, you will also need to leverage the [Multi-Resource Refresh Token](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/multi-resource-refresh-token) feature, where the refresh token delivered to your SPA will allow it to obtain an access token to call My Account API.
   - This will require defining a new [refresh token policy](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/multi-resource-refresh-token/configure-and-implement-multi-resource-refresh-token) for your SPA Application where the `audience` is `https://<your auth0 domain>/me/` and the `scope` should include at least the `"create:me:connected_accounts"` scope.
   - Setup steps:
     - In your Auth0 Dashboard, go to Applications, and open the Settings for your SPA application created at step 1.
     - Under the "Multi-Resource Refresh Token" section, click "Edit Configuration".
     - Enable MRRT for "Auth0 My Account API".

6. Configure a Social Connection for Google in Auth0
   - Make sure to enable the "Use for Connected Accounts with Token Vault" toggle
   - Make sure to enable `Offline Access` and all `Calendar` scopes from the Permissions options
   - On the Applications tab, make sure to enable the connection for your SPA Application created in Step 1
   - Test the connection in Auth0 "Try Connection" screen and make sure the connection is working & configured correctly

### 2. Environment Variables

#### Client (.env)
From the `./client` directory, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Auth0 configuration using details from your SPA Application:

```bash
# Auth0 Configuration
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-spa-client-id
VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-identifier

# Server Configuration
VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### Server (.env)
From the `./server` directory, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Auth0 configuration using details from API and Custom API Client:

```bash
# Auth0 Configuration
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain.auth0.com
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-identifier

# Custom API Client Configuration (for Token Vault token exchange)
# These credentials belong to Custom API client that can perform token exchanges
AUTH0_CUSTOM_API_CLIENT_ID=your-custom-api-client-id
AUTH0_CUSTOM_API_CLIENT_SECRET=your-custom-api-client-secret

# OpenAI Configuration  
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies from the project root
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Application

#### Start server and client in development mode with Turbo:
```bash
npm run dev
```

or run them individually with:
```bash
npm run dev:client    # Run the Vite dev server for React
npm run dev:server    # Run the Hono API backend
```

The client will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and will communicate with the server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Users can log in/out using Auth0 Universal Login
- **Protected API Calls**: Authenticated users can call protected endpoints with JWT tokens
- **Public API Calls**: Non-authenticated users can still call public endpoints
- **AI Chat Integration**: Authenticated users can chat with an AI assistant about their calendar
- **Token Exchange**: Token Vault performs token exchanges & securely manages tokens, allowing your API to access external APIs (like Google Calendar API) on behalf of users
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with shared types between client and server

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Public endpoint returning "Hello Hono!"
- `GET /hello` - Public endpoint returning JSON response
- `GET /api/external` - Protected endpoint requiring valid JWT token
- `POST /chat` - Protected AI chat endpoint with calendar integration (token exchange)

## Architecture

### Client (React + Vite)
- Uses `@auth0/auth0-spa-js` for authentication
- React Context for Auth0 state management
- Custom hook (`useAuth0`) for accessing auth state
- JWT tokens are automatically included in API calls

### Server (Hono + Node.js)
- Custom JWT middleware using `jose` library
- Validates tokens against Auth0's JWKS endpoint
- Type-safe API endpoints with shared types
- CORS configured for client-server communication

## SDK Notes

The core `@auth0/ai` package now supports:
- **Custom API Client Credentials**: Separate client credentials for token exchange operations
- **Access Token Support**: Direct access token exchange instead of requiring refresh tokens

The example uses the enhanced SDK pattern with dedicated access token support:
```typescript
// lib/auth.ts
const auth0AI = new Auth0AI({
  auth0: {
    domain: process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN!,
    // For token exchange with Token Vault, we want to provide the Custom API Client credentials
    clientId: process.env.AUTH0_CUSTOM_API_CLIENT_ID!, // Custom API Client ID for token exchange
    clientSecret: process.env.AUTH0_CUSTOM_API_CLIENT_SECRET!, // Custom API Client secret
  }
});

export const withGoogleCalendar = auth0AI.withTokenVault({
  accessToken: async () => global.authContext?.accessToken, // Access token for Token Vault token exchange
  connection: "google-oauth2",
  scopes: ["openid", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar"],
});
```

Tools can also now use the SDK's built-in token management when using access tokens with Token Vault token exchange:
```typescript
// tools/listNearbyEvents.ts
import { getAccessTokenFromTokenVault } from "@auth0/ai-vercel";

export const listNearbyEvents = withGoogleCalendar(
  tool({
    execute: async ({ start, end, calendarId }) => {
      const token = getAccessTokenFromTokenVault(); // Automatic token retrieval
      // Use token with Google Calendar API...
    }
  })
);
```
